# Budget App

This project is a budget app built using Ruby on Rails, as part of Microverse projects.

It allows you to manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

The [original design idea](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19759151/Snapscan-iOs-design-and-branding?tracking_source) is by Gregoire Vella on Behance.
